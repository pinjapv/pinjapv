**Hi, I'm Pinja 😊**

I'm a fresh MBA graduate with a background in accounting, administration, and financial reporting.

My goal is to build a career in business analysis: I'm interested in finding insights from data through analytics, and combining them with strategic thinking to develop business processes and pursue opportunities.

I'm currently creating this as my portfolio to showcase my analytic skills with e.g. Excel, Python, Power BI and SQL.

More projects will appear here soon! 🛠🏃🏻‍♀️
